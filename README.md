# Target Word Count

The Target Word Count plugin for Obsidian disables editing until you've added a target number of new words.

## Usage

Using the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`):

- **Target Word Count: Set New** initiates tracking. Once a target word count is set, you cannot delete content until you have added your targeted number of new words to Obsidian. Progress and editing restrictions are shared across all documents.
- **Target Word Count: Reset** will reset your progress to 0. Your target word count setting will remain.
- **Target Word Count: Stop** will halt all plugin functionality and allow editing. To start again, use **Target Word Count: Set New** listed above.
